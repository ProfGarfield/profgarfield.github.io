# improvementData

This module is used to associate data with individual improvements.  Functions are used to
get the data and to change it, so you don't have to interact and maintain the underlying
tables directly.  These functions also check the data that you input, so that errors are
caught quickly rather than being saved in tables only to surface later.

This module provides "flags", which store boolean values, "counters", which store number
values, and "phrases", which store string values.  There is also some basic "generic"
data storage, which can store "state savable" data, and so is more flexible, but also has
fewer error checks and built in features.  

These flags, counters, and phrases have names, which are strings.  To access a piece of data,
you will need to have the improvement it is associated with, as well as the name, and whether the
data is a flag, counter, or phrase.  Then, you can use one of the provided functions
to interact with that data.

By default, all data is nil.  However, flags, counters, and phrases will not return nil
when you get their values (generic, however, will).  Instead, when you define a
data entry, you will define a default value which is to be returned if the data is nil.
Functions are provided to check if the underlying value is actually nil, and to reset
the data to nil if you need to.  A data value stops being nil when you assign it an
actual value.

You can set data to update periodically, during onTurn, onTribeTurnBegin, or onTribeTurnEnd
events.  Flags and Phrases can be reset to nil automatically, while counters and generic data
can be assigned update parameters or functions.  Usually, updates are only performed on
data which is already non-nil, but you can choose to update all if that is needed for your
functionality.  The update time can also be set to 'custom', which will only update the
data on specific function call.




### changeValidationInfo
```
function improvementData.changeValidationInfo(improvement: improvementObject)
```
Replaces existing values of the sameItemCheck with new ones.



### counterAdd
```
function improvementData.counterAdd(improvement: improvementObject, counterName: string, increment: number, minValue?: number, maxValue?: number, moduleName?: string)
  -> number
```
Adds the increment to the improvement's counterName current value, but substituting minValue or maxValue
if the result is out of the range.  Then, the minimum and maximum values specified
when the counter was defined are applied (i.e. the minValue and maxValue here do not
override the defined min and max values).
Returns the value the counter was set to.



### counterGetValue
```
function improvementData.counterGetValue(improvement: improvementObject, counterName: string, moduleName?: string)
  -> number
```
Returns the value associated with the improvement's counter of counterName.
If the value is nil, the default specified during the definition is returned.



### counterIsAtLeast
```
function improvementData.counterIsAtLeast(improvement: improvementObject, counterName: string, threshold: number, moduleName?: string)
  -> boolean
```
Returns true if the improvement's counterName is at least the threshold
and false otherwise.



### counterIsAtMost
```
function improvementData.counterIsAtMost(improvement: improvementObject, counterName: string, threshold: number, moduleName?: string)
  -> boolean
```
Returns true if the improvement's counterName is at most the threshold
and false otherwise.



### counterIsNil
```
function improvementData.counterIsNil(improvement: improvementObject, counterName: string, moduleName?: string)
  -> boolean
```
 Returns true if the underlying value of improvement's counterName counter is nil
 and false otherwise.



### counterReset
```
function improvementData.counterReset(improvement: improvementObject, counterName: string, moduleName?: string)
  -> void
```
Sets the value associated with the improvement's counterName to nil
(meaning that it returns the default value set when it was defined).



### counterSetValue
```
function improvementData.counterSetValue(improvement: improvementObject, counterName: string, value: number, moduleName?: string)
  -> number
```
Sets the value associated with the improvement's counter of counterName to value.
If this value is outside the counter's defined maxValue and minValue,
those values are then applied.
Returns the value the counter was set to.



### counterSetWithin
```
function improvementData.counterSetWithin(improvement: improvementObject, counterName: string, minValue?: number, maxValue?: number, moduleName?: string)
  -> number
```
Sets the counter's current value within the minValue and maxValue specified
(This does not change the overall max and min set when defining the counter).
Returns the value the counter was set to.



### counterSubtract
```
function improvementData.counterSubtract(improvement: improvementObject, counterName: string, increment: number, minValue?: number, maxValue?: number, moduleName?: string)
  -> number
```
Subtracts the increment to the improvement's current value, but substituting minValue or maxValue
if the result is out of the range.  Then, the minimum and maximum values specified
when the counter was defined are applied (i.e. the minValue and maxValue here do not
override the defined min and max values).
Returns the value the counter was set to.



### defineCounter

    the counter is set to this number instead.
    - Default is `-math.huge`.
* maxValue = number
    - This is the largest number the counter can be.  If anything would set the counter above this number,
    the counter is set to this number instead

        +   but only if the counter isn't currently nil
        + "incrementAll" same as increment, but is also applied to improvements with nil as the underlying value of the counter
        + "set" means the counter is set to the updateParameter, but only applies if the counter isn't currently nil
        + "setAll" same as "set", but is also applied to improvements with nil as the underlying value of the counter
        + "reset" sets the underlying counter value to nil
        + "function" sets the underlying counter value to the result of updateParameter(formerUnderlyingValue,improvementID) (subject to maxValue and minValue), only for underlying values which are not nil
        + "functionAll" sets the underlying counter value to the result of updateParameter(formerUnderlyingValue,improvementID) (subject to maxValue and minValue), even for nil underlying values
    - Default is "none".
* updateTime = "never"\|"onTurn"\|"onTribeTurnBegin"\|"onTribeTurnEnd"\|"custom"

        + "onTurn" means at the very beginning of the onTurn event (before all other code)
        + "onTribeTurnBegin" means at the very start of the onTribeTurnBegin event for the owner (before all other code)
        + "onTribeTurnEnd" means at the very end of the onTribeTurnEnd event for the owner (after all other code)
        + if improvement has no owner, onTribeTurnBegin and onTribeTurnEnd updates happen
        during the onTurn update
        + "custom" means the update must be programmed in manually using improvementData.update
    - Default is "never".
* updateParameter = number\|nil\|function
    - if update is "increment","incrementAll", "set", "setAll" then this must be a number
    - if update is "none" or "reset", this is ignored and can be nil
    - if update is "function", this is a function(numberOrNil,improvementID) -> numberOrNil
    - Default is nil.
* nonInteger = bool\|nil
    - if true, the counter can take on non-integer values
    - if false, the value is rounded using math.floor(initialValue+0.5)
    - if nil, an error is thrown when the counter is set to a non-integer value
    - Default is nil.

function improvementData.flagSetValue(improvement: improvementObject, flagName: string, value: boolean, moduleName?: string)
```
Sets the value associated with the improvement's flag of flagName to the `value` 
(true or false) specified.



### generalUpdate
```
function improvementData.generalUpdate(time?: "custom"|"onTribeTurnBegin"|"onTribeTurnEnd"|"onTurn", tribe?: tribeObject)

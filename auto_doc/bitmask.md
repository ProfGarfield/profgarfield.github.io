# bitmask

<p>A bitmask is an integer that is not meant to be interpreted as a number, but rather as a sequence of 1's and 0's (the binary representation of the number), with each 1 or 0 representing whether a condition is true or false. Bitmasks often have functions written to facilitate their manipulation. If none are available, Lua provides bitwise operators.</p><p>Typically, the leftmost bit (the bit representing the largest value) is interpreted as negative. Hence, the bitmask integer is not guaranteed to be positive.</p>

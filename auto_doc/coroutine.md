# coroutine

A coroutine is a line of execution, with its own stack and its own local variables; but sharing global variables and mostly anything else with other coroutines. Coroutines are collaborative: A program with coroutines is, at any given time, running only one of its coroutines and this running coroutine only suspends its execution when it explicitly requests to be suspended.

# id

An id number is a positive integer that corresponds to an object in the game or the rules.txt file. If you know what <em>kind</em> of object the id corresponds to, you can then use the id to get the specific item in question. The maximum value for an id will depend on its corresponding object. For example, the maximum id for a tribe object is 7, but (at least for programming purposes) there is no limit to the id number of a unit.

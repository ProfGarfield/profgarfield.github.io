Functions are used to\nget the data and to change it, so you don't have to interact and maintain the underlying\ntables directly.  These functions also check the data that you input, so that errors are\ncaught quickly rather than being saved in tables only to surface later.\n\nThis module provides \"flags\", which store boolean values, \"counters\", which store number\nvalues, and \"phrases\", which store string values.  There is also some basic \"generic\"\ndata storage, which can store \"state savable\" data, and so is more flexible, but also has\nfewer error checks and built in features.  \n\nThese flags, counters, and phrases have names, which are strings.  To access a piece of data,\nyou will need to have the _item_ it is associated with, as well as the name, and whether the\ndata is a flag, counter, or phrase.  Then, you can use one of the provided functions\nto interact with that data.\n\nBy default, all data is nil.  However, flags, counters, and phrases will not return nil\nwhen you get their values (generic, however, will).  Instead, when you define a\ndata entry, you will define a default value which is to be returned if the data is nil.\nFunctions are provided to check if the underlying value is actually nil, and to reset\nthe data to nil if you need to.  A data value stops being nil when you assign it an\nactual value.\n\nYou can set data to update periodically, during onTurn, onTribeTurnBegin, or onTribeTurnEnd\nevents.  Flags and Phrases can be reset to nil automatically, while counters and generic data\ncan be assigned update parameters or functions.  Usually, updates are only performed on\ndata which is already non-nil, but you can choose to update all if that is needed for your\nfunctionality.  The update time can also be set to 'custom', which will only update the\ndata on specific function call.\n",

Functions are used to\nget the data and to change it, so you don't have to interact and maintain the underlying\ntables directly.  These functions also check the data that you input, so that errors are\ncaught quickly rather than being saved in tables only to surface later.\n\nThis module provides \"flags\", which store boolean values, \"counters\", which store number\nvalues, and \"phrases\", which store string values.  There is also some basic \"generic\"\ndata storage, which can store \"state savable\" data, and so is more flexible, but also has\nfewer error checks and built in features.  \n\nThese flags, counters, and phrases have names, which are strings.  To access a piece of data,\nyou will need to have the city it is associated with, as well as the name, and whether the\ndata is a flag, counter, or phrase.  Then, you can use one of the provided functions\nto interact with that data.\n\nBy default, all data is nil.  However, flags, counters, and phrases will not return nil\nwhen you get their values (generic, however, will).  Instead, when you define a\ndata entry, you will define a default value which is to be returned if the data is nil.\nFunctions are provided to check if the underlying value is actually nil, and to reset\nthe data to nil if you need to.  A data value stops being nil when you assign it an\nactual value.\n\nYou can set data to update periodically, during onTurn, onTribeTurnBegin, or onTribeTurnEnd\nevents.  Flags and Phrases can be reset to nil automatically, while counters and generic data\ncan be assigned update parameters or functions.  Usually, updates are only performed on\ndata which is already non-nil, but you can choose to update all if that is needed for your\nfunctionality.  The update time can also be set to 'custom', which will only update the\ndata on specific function call.\n",

In this case the coroutine resumes with the result of the round, a table containing four values:\n- winner, this is either attacker or defender.\n- attackerRoll, the result of the attacker's die roll\n- defenderRoll, the result of the defender's die roll\n- reroll, true if a reroll happened. \n\nThis can happen only if the attacker is tribe 0, the defender is a unit guarding a city, and the city is the capital or the tribe has less than 8 cities in total and the attacker's die roll is higher than the defender's. A reroll can happen at most once.\n",

Functions are used to\nget the data and to change it, so you don't have to interact and maintain the underlying\ntables directly.  These functions also check the data that you input, so that errors are\ncaught quickly rather than being saved in tables only to surface later.\n\nThis module provides \"flags\", which store boolean values, \"counters\", which store number\nvalues, and \"phrases\", which store string values.  There is also some basic \"generic\"\ndata storage, which can store \"state savable\" data, and so is more flexible, but also has\nfewer error checks and built in features.  \n\nThese flags, counters, and phrases have names, which are strings.  To access a piece of data,\nyou will need to have the tile it is associated with, as well as the name, and whether the\ndata is a flag, counter, or phrase.  Then, you can use one of the provided functions\nto interact with that data.\n\nBy default, all data is nil.  However, flags, counters, and phrases will not return nil\nwhen you get their values (generic, however, will).  Instead, when you define a\ndata entry, you will define a default value which is to be returned if the data is nil.\nFunctions are provided to check if the underlying value is actually nil, and to reset\nthe data to nil if you need to.  A data value stops being nil when you assign it an\nactual value.\n\nYou can set data to update periodically, during onTurn, onTribeTurnBegin, or onTribeTurnEnd\nevents.  Flags and Phrases can be reset to nil automatically, while counters and generic data\ncan be assigned update parameters or functions.  Usually, updates are only performed on\ndata which is already non-nil, but you can choose to update all if that is needed for your\nfunctionality.  The update time can also be set to 'custom', which will only update the\ndata on specific function call.\n",

When 16, tiles are read in 2 rows of 8, similar to the original overlays. When 1 or 3, tiles are read from a single row.<br>The use for the 3-tile overlay is to prevent the dithering used between different terrain types to render on top of the tile. These tiles correspond to the three tiles in TERRAIN1.bmp.<br>- The second number is the height of the tiles, 32, 48 or 64.<br>- The third number is the y-coordinate in TERRAIN2.bmp from where to start reading the tiles. The starting x-coordinate is always 1.<br><br>Notes:<br>- Tiles are expected to be separated from each other by a one-pixel border.<br>- River tiles are always read from their original position of (1, 67). River mouths and coastal tiles shift down, they are read from right below the bottommost overlay.<br>- In the absence of an @OVERLAYS section, overlays are defined to correspond to a default TERRAIN2.bmp file.<br>- This patch replaces the mountain height patch, but respects the \"MountainHeight\" key in COSMIC2 for compatibility when no overlays are defined.<br>- @OVERLAYS1 .. @OVERLAYS3 can be used for secondary maps, similarly to @TERRAIN1-3.",

Functions are used to\nget the data and to change it, so you don't have to interact and maintain the underlying\ntables directly.  These functions also check the data that you input, so that errors are\ncaught quickly rather than being saved in tables only to surface later.\n\nThis module provides \"flags\", which store boolean values, \"counters\", which store number\nvalues, and \"phrases\", which store string values.  There is also some basic \"generic\"\ndata storage, which can store \"state savable\" data, and so is more flexible, but also has\nfewer error checks and built in features.  \n\nThese flags, counters, and phrases have names, which are strings.  To access a piece of data,\nyou will need to have the tribe it is associated with, as well as the name, and whether the\ndata is a flag, counter, or phrase.  Then, you can use one of the provided functions\nto interact with that data.\n\nBy default, all data is nil.  However, flags, counters, and phrases will not return nil\nwhen you get their values (generic, however, will).  Instead, when you define a\ndata entry, you will define a default value which is to be returned if the data is nil.\nFunctions are provided to check if the underlying value is actually nil, and to reset\nthe data to nil if you need to.  A data value stops being nil when you assign it an\nactual value.\n\nYou can set data to update periodically, during onTurn, onTribeTurnBegin, or onTribeTurnEnd\nevents.  Flags and Phrases can be reset to nil automatically, while counters and generic data\ncan be assigned update parameters or functions.  Usually, updates are only performed on\ndata which is already non-nil, but you can choose to update all if that is needed for your\nfunctionality.  The update time can also be set to 'custom', which will only update the\ndata on specific function call.\n",

Functions are used to\nget the data and to change it, so you don't have to interact and maintain the underlying\ntables directly.  These functions also check the data that you input, so that errors are\ncaught quickly rather than being saved in tables only to surface later.\n\nThis module provides \"flags\", which store boolean values, \"counters\", which store number\nvalues, and \"phrases\", which store string values.  There is also some basic \"generic\"\ndata storage, which can store \"state savable\" data, and so is more flexible, but also has\nfewer error checks and built in features.  \n\nThese flags, counters, and phrases have names, which are strings.  To access a piece of data,\nyou will need to have the unit it is associated with, as well as the name, and whether the\ndata is a flag, counter, or phrase.  Then, you can use one of the provided functions\nto interact with that data.\n\nBy default, all data is nil.  However, flags, counters, and phrases will not return nil\nwhen you get their values (generic, however, will).  Instead, when you define a\ndata entry, you will define a default value which is to be returned if the data is nil.\nFunctions are provided to check if the underlying value is actually nil, and to reset\nthe data to nil if you need to.  A data value stops being nil when you assign it an\nactual value.\n\nYou can set data to update periodically, during onTurn, onTribeTurnBegin, or onTribeTurnEnd\nevents.  Flags and Phrases can be reset to nil automatically, while counters and generic data\ncan be assigned update parameters or functions.  Usually, updates are only performed on\ndata which is already non-nil, but you can choose to update all if that is needed for your\nfunctionality.  The update time can also be set to 'custom', which will only update the\ndata on specific function call.\n",
